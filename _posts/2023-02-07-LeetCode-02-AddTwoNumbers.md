### Problem

```
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
```

### Example

```
Example 1:

Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

```
Example 2:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

```
Example 3:

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```

### Code

```
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
     for (var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        for (var j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
            if (nums[i] + nums[j] === target) {
                return [i, j];
            }
        }
    }
};
```
